# Planimetry
On the left the user will have the various plans where by pressing the "Add" button he can add other plans.
Clicking on the name of the plan will allow the option to change the name of the plan.
By clicking on the name of the plan and then on the "Remove" button you can delete the plan.
At the center the user will have the 2D map of the plans.
Clicking on the "Edit" button will take you to the room editing page.
Here on the left instead of the plans you will have the various rooms of a floor with the same functionality as before.
At the center the user will find a 2D map of the selected room.
At the right are the devices that the user can add on the map with 'Drag and Drop'.
Instead of the "Edit" button there are 2 more buttons.
The first "Save" to save the various changes shown in the map.
The second "Cancel" to cancel the changes made.
Both will lead to the previous page.
